# Game design

- Will be played from a third person perspective, the player will have to think tactically as he has to guard his remaining health
- Player will also have to keep an eye on his own stamina and opponent's stamina, because plasma has no mass, but the lightsaber handle weighs something
- Player will have to block lightsaber attack or execute his own lightsaber attack with correct timing
- Each player's win increases the difficulty of the opponent (moving to the next game level)
- If player loses, the difficulty is reset to the beginning (going to the first game level)
- Music will be playing in the background
